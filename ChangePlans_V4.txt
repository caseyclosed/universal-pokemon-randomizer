RandomizerGUI romLoaded state matches new Settings object
All fields should be private and only accessible through getters/setters
Trainer Options to new class
Starter Options to new class
Evolution Options to new class
All other group options to new class
Move ROMEntry to separate Class
Move RomHandler state to Model Class
Change Settings toString and fromString to refer to a separate list. Try to make saving options easier when adding new options
Try to automatically create all boilerplate settings code (get setting, set setting, from string, to string, initial form state, enable or disable, rom loaded, etc)
Redo code to use PokemonCollection or Eclipse Collections (https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/docs/guide.md#eclipse-collections-reference-guide, https://www.infoq.com/articles/Refactoring-to-Eclipse-Collections/)
Redo Gen4 WriteEncounters to not use iterator
Text support for all generations instead of just gen 5
Redo change methods to be in single location to support methods added from hacks
Types, EvolutionTypes, and Constants are moved to a "default" model while providing ability to override with ROM specific details (remove things like if type is hack, or modify evolution methods)
Make sure all files are opened via try-with-resources
TemplateData to reload dynamically from disk and not require reload
Move read rom to new class
Consolidate config reading to single class instead of 1 per rom handler
Unit Tests use common data model
Unit tests deterministic (random should print seed and be sourced from manually input seed)
Unit test more GenRestrictions
Unit test RomEntry
Replace versioning system with more robust model (190 -> 200 is stupid, maybe find maven package for versioning)
Add docstrings to all functions
Remove all warnings
Possible Options - Code coverage, code quality lint
---------------
Investigate NDS ROM writing to support rewriting hacks like SS/SG/BB/VW
Create/Update offset finder
- https://github.com/Joexv/Advanced-Offset
- output type offset (each game has a different series, see https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=313872)
- output new evolution methods
- output new Types
Fix Support for Renegade Platinum - Rival Carries Starter/Team
Add support for 
- Blaze Black and Volt White 1/2 (not the redux versions)
  - Currently BB2 does not load post randomization, and VW2 gets stuck after getting a starter
- Glazed (this is an emerald rom)
- Storm Silver
- Sacred Gold
- Unbound (fails due to bad pointer behavior of ending in 09)
- Radical Red (fails due to bad pointer behavior of ending in 09)
- Following Renegade Platinum

Investigate ZX randomizer for adding pokemon to trainers and adding "useful"/"consumable" items to Pokemon
Choose exp curve for legends and a separate selection for non-legends
Randomize roaming pokemon in Gen 3+ (https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/n0xsrl/version_190_of_universal_pokemon_randomizer/h4iiwzw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
Gen4 Trades should use new pokemon (still uses old pokemon)
Gen4 leader TM should use new names
TM text updates for Gen 5 (use new names)
List new item locations (where can dragonscale be found)
Docker for building JAR and making into EXE
Gym leader / E4 pokemon should have better movesets (2 moves same type max, 1 status move, 1 move from outside last 4 learned)
Change AI levels for Gen 3 - 5
-- Gen 3 4 5 only. Set under TrainerPokemon as AILevel
-- Gen 3 - 0 to 250 (probably could do 255)
-- Gen 4 - 0 to 250 (probably could do 255)
-- Gen 5 - 0 to 250 (probably could do 255)
Black / White trainer N should always have a legendary for final fight (s) 
Trainer Class Names should be gender based (Rich Boy woman not allowed) (group all trainer names and determine a 1-1 swap)
Signature Move - All leaders have a signature move on all pokes (same as TM?)
Type by ace (one of dual type, or if mono type, keeps mono) (keep type but change team)
Magikarp Mode (everything is magikarp, everyone has hyper beam, and all text is changed to MAGIKARP)
RSE Gen 3 - Patch both Arco and Mach
Trainer pokemon evolve at appropriate level (if at level, evolve. if not, unevolve. non-level base off bst)
Select full team instead of only starter (is it possible to prestock a pc?)
Shift abilities to left or right instead of randomizing (thus activating hidden abilities)
Enable patching randomization formulas
Evolution level randomized into a range based on the resulting BST
Randomize attack effects (romHandler.saveMoves)
Move prefixes (DEFDN-Leer)
Add PokemonEmerald Party Randomizer
Platinum rival gets random replacement for Heracross when "Carries Team" is active

All versions to 201
Update settings updater
Verify docs
Update premade settings
Move options around so non-visible options are at bottom (particularly trainer and starter)
Test all english roms with random settings 3 times each (save settings prior to randomizing in case of infinite loop)
PR merge_master against master and investigate anomolies
Build exe and zip into github
